// X5CIssuerKeyResolver implements SDJWTVCIssuerKeyResolver by
// validating a presented "dc+sd-jwt" credential's own "x5c" header
// (RFC 7515 §4.1.6) against Roots — HAIP 1.0 §5.3's own MUST for
// "dc+sd-jwt" issuer trust, which SDJWTVCIssuerKeyResolver's own doc
// comment names as a deployment policy decision but leaves
// unimplemented anywhere in this repo. Confirmed live against the
// OpenID Foundation conformance suite's own two checks on this exact
// requirement ("Credential MUST contain an x5c in the header", "Leaf
// certificate in x5c chain must not be self-signed" —
// cmd/conformance-wallet-vp's own README) — this resolver enforces
// both on the verifying side, not just the issuing side
// credential/sdjwtvc.IssueOptions.IssuerCertificate satisfies on the
// issuing side.
//
// A self-signed leaf is always rejected, even if that exact
// certificate also happens to be present in Roots — see
// internal/certchain.VerifyLeaf's own doc comment for why.
